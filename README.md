Dijkstra's algorithm and A* algorithm have been employed to determine the shortest path from the starting point to the destination. 
These algorithms enhance pathfinding efficiency by minimizing travel distance and computational cost, ensuring accurate and optimal navigation. While Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm excels in finding the shortest path in weighted graphs by exploring all possible routes, A* leverages heuristic functions to further optimize the search process by prioritizing promising paths. 
By combining these advanced techniques, the solution achieves improved performance, reduced processing time, and increased accuracy in dynamic environments, making it highly effective for real-time applications such as GPS navigation, robotics, and game development.
